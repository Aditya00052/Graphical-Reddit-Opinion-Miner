<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this project i have performend Reddit Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and visualized the result using a graph.</p>

<h4>1.1 NLP</h4>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a field within computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on how computers interact with human languages, particularly in developing methods for processing and analyzing vast amounts of natural language data. It is a subset of machine learning dedicated to text analysis and predictive analytics.</p>

<h4>1.2 NLTK</h4>
<p>The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform designed for creating Python-based programs that process human language data, particularly for use in statistical natural language processing (NLP). It provides libraries for various text processing tasks, including tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging, and semantic analysis.</p>


<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Visualizations tend to have a stronger impact than words alone, making them easier to grasp and understand. Reading blogs also plays a significant role in learning, as it helps you discover new concepts and technologies. When I came across NLP, it immediately piqued my interest, and the idea of working on it struck me. What really caught my attention was visualizing live Twitter sentiment through graphs, which motivated me to start working on Reddit sentiment analysis.</p>


<h3>Stpes for the project:</h3>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a classification model using NLTK and Sci-kit learn</li>
  <li>
    Fetching reddit data
    <ul>
      <li>Getting reddit api bearer token</li>
      <li>Fetching reddit data using the bearer token</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entering the phase or words whose relevant reddit data you want to capture</li>
  <li>Ploting the captured data on a graph</li>
</ul>


<h3>Final Result</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When we gave the word iphone.The live that is been created using live data coming from Twitter streaming API has a graph with decreaing y-axis showing negative reddit for the "iphone" word:</li>
